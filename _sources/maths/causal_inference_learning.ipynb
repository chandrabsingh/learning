    "\n",
    "## Randomized Controlled Tests (RCTs)\n",
    "- also called as **A/B testing**\n",
    "- in e-commerce test, email is sent around hoping that it will help increase purchase conversion\n",
    "- but dont know if these email will help or hurt\n",
    "- test this using RCTs\n",
    "- 5 steps\n",
    "  - select users to participate using some uniform criteria\n",
    "  - split users into 2 groups evenly\n",
    "  - one group send email(Treatment group) and not to the other(Control group)\n",
    "  - Monitor purchase conversion for each user over time\n",
    "  - Make decision based on test results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why RCTs**\n",
    "- Users are selected randomly to be part of control and treatment group\n",
    "- because the only difference between these two groups is that one receives email and other doesn't\n",
    "- by controlling the effects of other variables through randomization, experiment results gives confidence\n",
    "- randomized tests can also be used for inferring causality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenarios when RCTs cannot be run**\n",
    "- setting up experiment is not possible\n",
    "  - for example: efficacy of billboard ads \n",
    "- experiment takes too long\n",
    "  - make inferences based on historically observed data\n",
    "    - but make sure that other factors dont affect the observations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges to Causal Inferencing\n",
    "- 3 main challenges\n",
    "  - **Confounders**\n",
    "    - before releasing a new medical product, clinical trial is needed\n",
    "    - such test is possible\n",
    "    - one group of users - treatment group is given the new product and a placebo or no treatment to the control group\n",
    "    - if treatment group has recovered lot more than control group, it implies that new product works\n",
    "    - but the average age of treatment group is 25 compared to control group average age of 70\n",
    "      - so this doesnot give definitive conclusion of the test\n",
    "    - **age is a confounding variable**\n",
    "    - age variable is not controlled and can have a causal effect \n",
    "    - confounding variable is a challenge in causal inferencing that uses prior data\n",
    "  - **Selection Bias**\n",
    "    - the chosen group is not a good representation of all users in the population\n",
    "  - **Counterfactuals**\n",
    "    - what would have happened if person not received the new medication\n",
    "    - conterfactuals must be tested for each individual, while conducting the test\n",
    "    - so that apples-to-apples comparison is done\n",
    "    - strategies - for example: matching\n",
    "\n",
    "## Causal Graphs and assumptions\n",
    "**why assumptions**\n",
    "- prior data is tailored to make it representative as a randomized control test as much as possible\n",
    "- there will always be some confounders which will have some weird and unintended effects on the outcome, that cannot be controlled\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the assumptions**\n",
    "- **Causal Markov Condition (Markov Assumption)**\n",
    "  - Causal graphs are need for analysis\n",
    "    - Causal graphs are graphs with directed graphs that show causation\n",
    "  - If convoluted, to simplify the causal graph to be a directed acyclic graph (DAG), \n",
    "    - Confounders have an effect on Treatment and Outcome (C->T, C->O)\n",
    "    - Treatment has an effect on Outcome (T->O)\n",
    "- **SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption)**\n",
    "  - a sample in the control group doesn't affect the samples in the treatment group\n",
    "  - this assumption is required to prevent any interaction effect\n",
    "  - people who receive the new medicine will not influence the people who dont receive it\n",
    "- **Ignorability**  \n",
    "  - there is no additional confounders that has an effect on the treatmnet and the output\n",
    "  - this is important, as even if treatment group does better, the cause cannot be assured of\n",
    "- https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/474616/strong-ignorability-confusion-on-the-relationship-between-outcomes-and-treatmen\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Measuring Average Treatment Effect**\n",
    "  - Does the new medicine make people feel better\n",
    "    - take users as a column\n",
    "    - treatment outcome column - whether belonged to treatment group or not\n",
    "    - control outcome column - whether belonged to control group or not\n",
    "    - calculate Mean(Treatment) = $\\frac{\\text{Count of people within treatment group who improved}}{\\text{Total count of people belonging to treatment group}}$\n",
    "    - calculate Mean(Decision) = $\\frac{\\text{Count of people within control group who improved}}{\\text{Total count of people belonging to control group}}$\n",
    "    - calculate Effect = Difference of the two means\n",
    "      - this tells us if the impact is positive or negative\n",
    "    - to test confounding effects\n",
    "      - calculate Mean(Age | Treatment group if impact was positive)\n",
    "      - calculate Mean(Age | Control group if impact was positive)\n",
    "        - if the average age of treatment group people who improved, is substantially higher than of the average age of control group people who improved, that implies age is a confounding variable\n",
    "    - to solve for this problem, **determine the counterfactuals for every person taken into account**\n",
    "    - could the group of people who took medicine got improvement without medicine and could the group of people who did not take medicine and got better, got improvement with medicine\n",
    "    - this can be done using \"matching\"\n",
    "    - find people of the same age who receive the other treatment and use that as counterfactual estimate\n",
    "    - the other technique is machine learning, where a model is built that takes input as confounders(age) and treatment and then predicts the output, train it on factual data and try to predict the counterfactuals\n",
