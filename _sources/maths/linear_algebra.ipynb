Orthogonal basis then means the ability to decompose an effect into separate, independent, non-interacting parts that simply add up to form the whole effect. This kind of decomposition is hugely important in situations where it can be done.\n",

So, we can compute the projection of v on $𝑥_{1}$  instantaneously without inner product: the projections are just coefficients of the corresponding basis components.
