    "- Copy all the lines in buffer: `:%y+`\n",
    "- Delete all the lines in file: `:1,\\$d`\n",
    "- Delete lines from cursor to specific line number: `:.,10d`\n",
    "- Delete current line: `:.d`\n",
    "- Exit without saving: `:q!`\n",
    "- Save and exit: `:wq`\n",
    "- Insert mode: `:I`\n",
    "- Copy next 2 lines: `2yy`\n",
    "- Paste copied items: `p`\n",
    "- Copy/Paste specific line numbers:\n",
    "  - yank those lines in register:\n",
    "  > `:364,757y`\n",
    "  - if you want to copy those lines and paste to some certain line, t is your friend. for example:\n",
    "  > `:364,757t2`  - will copy those lines to under 2nd line.\n",
    "  - if you want to copy them to right under your current line:\n",
    "  > `:364,757t.` \n",
    "- Undo last command: `u`\n",
    "- Undo last 2 commands: `2u`\n",
    "- For tab characters that appear 4-spaces-wide: `set tabstop=4`\n",
    "- If you're using actual tab character in your source code you probably also want these settings (these are actually the defaults, but you may want to set them defensively): `set softtabstop=0 noexpandtab`\n",
    "- Finally, if you want an indent to correspond to a single tab, you should also use: `set shiftwidth=4`\n",
    "- For indents that consist of 4 space characters but are entered with the tab key: `set tabstop=8 softtabstop=0 expandtab shiftwidth=4 smarttab`\n",
    "- Permanent setting in `~/.vimrc`:  `:set number`  \n",
    "- Comment in ~/.vimrc `\" This is comment`\n",
    "- to search for all occurences, with highlight\n",
    "> set hlsearch  \n",
    "> `/\\cGoogle`  \n",
    "> set nohlsearch  \n",
    "- Search and replace `:[range]s/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] [count]`\n",
    "  - To search for the first occurrence of the string ‘foo’ in the current line and replace it with ‘bar’, you would use: `:s/foo/bar/`\n",
    "  - To replace all occurrences of the search pattern in the current line, add the g flag: `:s/foo/bar/g`\n",
    "  - If you want to search and replace the pattern in the entire file, use the percentage character \\% as a range. This character indicates a range from the first to the last line of the file: `:%s/foo/bar/g`\n",
    "  - If the {string} part is omitted, it is considered as an empty string, and the matched pattern is deleted. The following command deletes all instances of the string ‘foo’ in the current line: `:s/foo//g`\n",
    "  - Instead of the slash character (/), you can use any other non-alphanumeric single-byte character except as a delimiter. This option is useful when you have the ‘/’ character in the search pattern or the replacement string: `:s|foo|bar|`\n",
    "  - To confirm each substitution, use the c flag: `:s/foo/bar/gc`\n",
    "  - You can also use regular expressions as a search pattern. The command bellow replaces all lines starting with ‘foo’ with ‘Vim is the best’: `:%s/^foo.*/Vim is the best/gc`\n",
    "  - By default, the search operation is case sensitive; searching for “FOO” will not match “Foo”. To ignore case for the search pattern, use the i flag: `:s/Foo/bar/gi`\n",
    "  - To substitute all occurrences of 'foo' to 'bar' in all lines starting from line 3 to line 10 you would use(range is inclusive): `:3,10s/foo/bar/g`\n",
    "  - The dot . character indicates the current line and \\$ - the dollar sign the last line. To substitute ‘foo’ in all lines starting from the current line to the last one: `:.,$s/foo/bar/`\n",
    "  - To search for a whole word, type \\< to mark the beginning of a word, enter the search pattern, type \\> to mark the end of a word: `:s/\\<foo\\>/bar/`\n",
    "  - Comment lines (add # before the line) from 5 to 20: `:5,20s/^/#/`\n",
    "  - Uncomment lines from 5 to 20, revert the previous changes: `:5,20s/^#//`\n",
    "  - Replace all instances of ‘apple’, ‘orange’, and ‘mango’ with ‘fruit’: `:%s/apple\\|orange\\|mango/fruit/g`\n",
    "  - Remove trailing whitespace at the end of each line: `:%s/\\s\\+$//e`\n",
    "- To run shell commands while on vim use `:!ls`\n",
    "- To run shell commands and copy the result of executed command into opened vim document `:.!ls`\n",
    "- To list directory names only: `ls -d */`\n",
