    "  - focuses mainly on code rather than the system/infrastructure\n",
    "    - focus more on the business logic and purpose of the application\n",
    "  - serverless functions run on managed machines\n",

    "      - 100% utilization is never possible\n",
    "    - one pays for the fraction of seconds the lambda service is used\n",
    "  - Managed machines\n",
