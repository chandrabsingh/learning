    "The Node Similarity algorithm compares pairs of nodes in a graph based on their connections to other nodes. Two nodes are considered similar if they share many of the same neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The node similarity is computed using pair-wise similarities based on either the Jaccard metric also known as Jaccard Similarity Score, or the Overlap coefficient also known as the Szymkiewiczâ€“Simpson coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two sets A and B, the **Jaccard Similarity** is computed using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(A, B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|} = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "The nodes A and B are similar if most nodes that are neighbors to either node are also neighbors to both.\n",

    "The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The input of this algorithm is a bipartite, connected graph containing two disjoint node sets. \n",

    "- The Node Similarity algorithm compares all nodes from the first node set with each other based on their relationships to nodes in the second set. \n",
    "- The complexity of this comparison grows quadratically with the number of nodes to compare. \n",
    "- The algorithm reduces the complexity by ignoring disconnected nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Node Similarity has time complexity $O(n^3)$ and space complexity $O(n^2)$. We compute and store neighbour sets in time and space $O(n^2)$, then compute pairwise similarity scores in time $O(n^3)$.\n",
